# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# CS-31 Minesweeper Game - React

A React-based implementation of the classic Minesweeper game built with Vite for fast development and hot module replacement.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 22.0 or higher)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

## Project Setup

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Project

### Development Mode

To start the development server with hot module replacement:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is occupied).

### Building for Production

To create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist` directory.

### Preview Production Build

To preview the production build locally:

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint for code quality checks

## Project Structure

```

├── main.jsx         # Application entry point
├── index.css        # Global styles
└── assets/          # Static assets (images, icons, etc.)
```

## Development

- The project uses Vite for fast development with hot module replacement
- ESLint is configured for code quality and consistency
- React 19 with modern hooks and functional components
- CSS for styling (can be extended with CSS modules or styled-components)
